# Akindu's Calculator

Akindu's Calculator is a simple and user-friendly calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides basic arithmetic operations and some additional features to enhance the user experience.

## Features

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: The calculator can perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

2. **Keyboard Support**: Users can input numbers and operators, calculate results, and clear the display using their keyboard. The key mappings are as follows:
   - Numbers: `0-9`
   - Operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, [`/`], [`.`]
   - Calculate Result: `Enter` or `=`
   - Clear Display: `Backspace`
